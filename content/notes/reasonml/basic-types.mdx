# What's new compared to JS?

Doesn't support ad hoc polymorphism yet; Use different operators for different operand types

```reasonml
2.0 +. 1.0;

2 + 1;

"abc" ++ "def";
```  

`<`, `>` are polymorphic, but doesn't work when both the operands are of not same type.

<br/>

ReasonML strings are encoded as UTF-8 and not compatible with JS UTF-16 strings. Use BuckleScript JS strings instead

```reasonml
JS.log("äöü")
```

<br/>

Unit type - `()`; used for functions with side effects that don't return anything

```reasonml
# print string
: - string => unit => <fun>
```
